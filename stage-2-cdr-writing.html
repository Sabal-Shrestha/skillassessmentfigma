          <h2>Stage 2 CDR Writing</h2>
          <p>
            If you wish to seek Stage 2 competency, you need to provide your
            previously submitted Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) and CV
            demonstrating your engineering competence. Our professionals and
            specialists have created the necessary documents for Stage 2 CDR
            writing over the years.
          </p>
          <h2>What is Stage 2 Competency Assessment?</h2>
          <p>
            The competency Standard is a measure of the applicant's knowledge,
            skill, engineering application abilities, and technical
            qualifications, principles, and disciplines that are required to be
            able to work alone or without supervision.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to become a Chartered Professional Engineer, an applicant
            must pass a Competency Standard Stage 2 assessment. This assesses
            their knowledge, skills, and engineering application abilities in
            technical qualifications, principles, and disciplines, as well as
            their ability to work without supervision. Achieving the highest
            level of competency requires years of hard work, proof of
            professional competency as a leader, expertise, performance, and
            safety must also be demonstrated in order to become a chartered
            engineer with Engineers Australia.
          </p>
