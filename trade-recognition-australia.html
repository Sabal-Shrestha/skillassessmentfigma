          <h2>What is Trade Recognition Australia (TRA) Skill Assessment?</h2>
          <p>
            Trade Recognition Australia (TRA) is the main governing body that
            evaluates if your educational qualifications and work experience is
            at professional level for trade occupations in Australia. It
            specializes in assessing people with trade skills. It includes
            welders, electricians, chefs, plumbers, and more. Certification by
            TRA also increases your points in their immigration system.
          </p>
          <p>
            It checks if your formal education and vocational experience is up
            to the Australian industry standards. Your education and work
            experience needs to be closely related to your nominated occupation
            for the visa type you are applying. The Skilled Occupation List
            (SOL) includes over 160 occupations in the trade fields. These are
            mostly jobs which are in shortage in the local labor market. After
            fulfilling all its criteria, it awards a certificate of
            qualification or a license which can then be used to migrate to
            Australia.
          </p>
          <h2>Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            Want to check if you are eligible to qualify in TRA Migration Skills
            Assessment? You need to prove the following information by procuring
            documentary evidence:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You must be from a country listed by the TRA.</li>
            <li>You must be in the occupation covered by their MSA program.</li>
            <li>
              You must possess qualifications comparable to the Australian
              qualification for the nominated occupation.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must have completed three years of full time paid or
              equivalent part time employment in your nominated occupation at
              the skill level required.
            </li>
            <li>You must have paid a fee of $1000.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Skill Assessment Programs</h2>
          <p>Here are the assessment programs of TRA:</p>
          <h3>Job Ready Program</h3>
          <p>
            It is an employment based skill assessment for international
            students of a nominated country. They must have Australian
            qualifications. It offers them the opportunity for growth in the
            nominated occupation, work experience in Australian work settings,
            and an outcome to provide to the Department of Home Affairs while
            applying for a skilled migration permanent residency visa.
          </p>
          <h3>TSS Skills Assessment Program</h3>
          <p>
            TSS Skills Assessments are for those applicants of Temporary Skills
            Shortage (TSS) visa who hold the passport of a nominated country and
            are involved in nominated occupation. It assesses if you have the
            necessary skills and experience to work professionally in Australia.
            It checks your qualifications and skills to determine if they are of
            the Australian standards. They recruit people, who can contribute to
            their economy, because they face shortages in their local labor
            market in those occupations.
          </p>
          <h3>Offshore Skill Assessment Program</h3>
          <p>
            Those candidates, who are applying for a skilled migration visa and
            are from a nominated country and in a nominated occupation, fall
            under this category. It is applicable to air conditioning or
            refrigeration mechanics, plumbers, electricians and so on. It
            assesses the skills and experience gained overseas by the applicants
            for recognition of their skills and for the purpose of migration.
            The visa type they are seeking for is skilled migration permanent
            residency visa.
          </p>
          <h3>TRA Migration Skill Assessment</h3>
          <p>
            By applying for Migration Skill Assessment by TRA, the applicant can
            prove that the qualifications, skills, and experience he/she is
            bringing to Australia with him/her is equivalent to the skills
            required to function professionally in the Australian workplace. TRA
            recognizes their qualifications and skills of being of the
            Australian standards. In this way, with Migration Skill Assessment,
            you can move forward in your career in Australia too in the field
            you had been engaged in your home country.
          </p>
          <h3>Migration Points Advice</h3>
          <p>
            Australia has a point based immigration system, which means that
            every immigrant is judged on the points they receive before they get
            entry into the country. For instance, if you are between the age of
            25 to 33, you score 30 points, and if you are proficient in English
            you receive 10 points. In this way, they analyze all those who apply
            for visas. In this way, they supply the necessary manpower to their
            growing economy. You require a total of 65 points to be eligible for
            migration to Australia. Migration Points Advice evaluates where the
            applicant stands in their points-based system.
          </p>
          <h3>Skills Assessment Opportunities for Migrants Pilot</h3>
          <p>
            Those migrants who are living in Australia because of their eligible
            partner, family, humanitarian or refugee visas and have never gone
            through skills assessment fall under Skills Assessment Opportunities
            for Migrants Pilot program. They have adequate qualifications,
            skills and experience in the nominated occupation but have not been
            recognized by any of the Skills Assessment Programs. They can be
            granted quick skills assessments and become eligible for occupations
            in their field of work. The recognition from Skills Assessment
            Opportunities for Migrants Pilot proves that the applicant is
            skilled enough to work in professional settings in Australia.

          <h2>Pre Migration Assessment</h2>
          <p>
            There are groups that require pre-migration assessment. In other
            words, there are groups of people, whose vocational skills need to
            be assessed by the concerned authority before they migrate to
            Australia. They fall under mainly two groups:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Applicants under GSM (General Skilled Migration) program</li>
            <li>
              Applicants under Employer Sponsored Migration program (this could
              be waived under certain circumstances)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Migrants from humanitarian, working holiday makers, and family
            streams are not required to have any pre-migration assessment. The
            main pre-migration assessing body is Trade Recognition Australia
            (TRA), while the other pre-migration assessing body is Vocational
            Education Training and Assessment Services (VETASSES) for
            occupations that do not fall under the traditional trade definition.
          </p>
          <h2>Post Migration Recognition</h2>
          <p>
            A larger range of groups may need to obtain post-migration
            recognition of trade qualifications. They are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Immigrants, under the GSM program, who require professional
              registration or licensing
            </li>
            <li>
              Those who need to get their skills assessed such as family members
              of the migrants under secondary GSM program applicants
            </li>
            <li>Those who have entered Australia under humanitarian grounds</li>
            <li>Temporary residents who want to work in Australia</li>
            <li>
              Australian citizens who have received qualifications from other
              countries
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The type of occupation engaged in determines the nature of the
            assessment. In many occupations under VETASSESS, regulation is not
            required. It is completely the employer’s wish to demand documents
            required from the employees for the occupation in question. There
            are a number of occupations that do require registration and
            licensing while a number of them don’t. Licensing is done “for
            public health and safety reasons or to reflect internationally
            accepted standards of practice”. Registration and licensing is up to
            the state or territory to decide.
