            including even a small typo. Naturally, we put the final touches
            towards the end. We send it for submission only after thorough
            review.

            The art of CDR reviewing, with its numerous revisions and
            proofreads, is one in which we also excel. Unpolished CDRs are
            frequently rejected for this reason. When it comes to perfecting the
            reports, our seasoned writers in practically every technical field
            will offer you constructive criticisms and insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, they let you know if anything in the report offends
            Australian sensibilities and, subsequently, diminishes your chances.
            They will continue to work on your CDR report until it is ready for
            submission to Skill Assessment Australia.
